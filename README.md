This project discusses exhaust fan control using a temperature sensor to turn the fan ON/OFF automatically if the temperature is 25°C to turn on the exhaust fan and when the temperature is below 25°C it will turn the exhaust fan off.

An exhaust fan is a device designed to remove dirty, hot, or humid air from a room and replace it with fresh outdoor air. Its main function is to improve air circulation, maintain indoor air quality, and prevent excessive moisture, odors, or pollutants. Commonly used in bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, and industrial areas, it expels air through vents or ducts. Exhaust fans come in various types, such as wall, ceiling, or window-mounted models, and can be chosen based on installation needs and location.

The components used are:
1. DS18B20 temperature sensor
2. Relay
3. Controller
4. Power supply
5. 16x2 LCD
